# VB.NET Microsoft Excel Interoperability Tool
This module will take in a listview and a few optional variables and spit out a formatted Excel spreadsheet with the listview data.
The optional variables requested include a file name and the option to print the document.
If a file name is provided, the excel application will be ran as a background process.
If a file name isn't provided, the excel application will be opened on the user's desktop.
